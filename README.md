# Word Style Checking Add-in Built on Angular 2.0

Learn how to create an add-in that uses the `LocationRelation` and `compareLocationWith` APIs of the Word JavaScript APIs to perform a search and replace that skips some ranges based on their location relative to other ranges. The add-in is built on the Angular 2.0 framework, and it also shows how to use the design samples from [Office Add-in UX Design Patterns Code](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code).

## Change History

August 1, 2016:

* Initial version.

September 15 - October 17th, 2016:

* Minor updates.

## Prerequisites

* Word 2016 for Windows, build 16.0.6727.1000 or later.
* [Node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) The project is configured to use npm as both a package manager and a task runner. It is also configured to use the Lite Server built into npm as the web server that will host the add-in during development, so you can have the add-in up and running quickly. You are welcome to use another task runner or web server.
* [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (Or another git client.)

## Configure the project

In the folder where you want to put the project, run the following commands in the git bash shell:

1. ```git clone {URL of this repo}``` to clone this repo to your local machine.
2. ```npm install``` to install all of the dependencies itemized in the package.json file.
3. ```bash gen-cert.sh``` to create the certificate needed to run this sample. 

Set the certificate to be a trusted root authority. On a Windows machine, these are the steps:

1. In the repo folder on your local computer, double-click ca.crt, and select **Install Certificate**. 
2. Select **Local Machine** and select **Next** to continue. 
3. Select **Place all certificates in the following store** and then select **Browse**.
4. Select **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** and then select **OK**. 
5. Select **Next** and then **Finish**. 

## Deploy the add-in

Now you need to let Microsoft Word know where to find the add-in.

1. Create a network share, or [share a folder to the network](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc770880.aspx).
2. Place a copy of the Word-Add-in-Angular2-StyleChecker.xml manifest file, from the root of the project, into the shared folder.
3. Launch Word and open a document.
4. Choose the **File** tab, and then choose **Options**.
5. Choose **Trust Center**, and then choose the **Trust Center Settings** button.
6. Choose **Trusted Add-ins Catalogs**.
7. In the **Catalog Url** field, enter the network path to the folder share that contains Word-Add-in-Angular2-StyleChecker.xml, and then choose **Add Catalog**.
8. Select the **Show in Menu** check box, and then choose **OK**.
9. A message is displayed to inform you that your settings will be applied the next time you start Microsoft Office. Close Word.

## Run the project

1. Open a node command window in the folder of the project and run ```npm start``` to start the web service. Leave the command window open.
2. Open Internet Explorer or Edge and enter ```https://localhost:3000``` in the address box. If you do not receive any warnings about the certificate, close the browser and continue with the section below titled **Start the add-in**. If you do receive a warning that the certificate is not trusted, continue with the following steps:
3. The browser gives you a link to open the page despite the warning. Open it.
4. After the page opens, there will be a red certificate error in the address bar. Double click the error.
5. Select **View Certificate**.
5. Select **Install Certificate**.
4. Select **Local Machine** and select **Next** to continue. 
3. Select **Place all certificates in the following store** and then select **Browse**.
4. Select **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** and then select **OK**. 
5. Select **Next** and then **Finish**.
6. Close the browser.

## Start the add-in

1. Restart Word and open a Word document.
2. On the **Insert** tab in Word 2016, choose **My Add-ins**.
3. Select the **SHARED FOLDER** tab.
4. Choose **Style Checker**, and then select **OK**.
5. If add-in commands are supported by your version of Word, the UI will inform you that the add-in was loaded.
6. On the Home ribbon is a new group called **Style Checker** with a button labeled **Show** and a blue pencil icon. Click that button and the add-in will open to a page of instructions.

 > Note: The add-in will load in a task pane if add-in commands are not supported by your version of Word.

## Test the add-in

1. When you are finished with the instructions, click **Get Started**.
2. When the **Find and Replace** page opens, there is a command bar at the top with a menu button. Click the button to open the menu.
3. Select **Insert sample content**. Click the button again to close the menu. The document now has unformatted text about Office Add-ins, including a fictional quotation. The writer has used an "OAI" to abbreviate "Office Add-in" and so does the anonymous quotation.
4. In the **Find** box enter "OAI". 
5. In the **Replace** box enter "Office Add-in".
6. The change should ***not*** be made in the paragraph that is a direct quotation, so enter the number **2** in the **Skip Paragraph Number** box. This is the zero-based number of the paragraph.
7. Select **Replace**. Every instance of "OAI" except the one in the skipped paragraph is changed.
8. Experiment with other search and replace strings.

 > Note: This sample add-in accepts only one number in the **Skip Paragraph Number** box. A production add-in would allow multiple paragraphs to be skipped and would have additional ways of designating which paragraphs should be skipped; such as skipping based on paragraph style.

## Change the settings of the add-in

1. Open the menu button on the command bar again and select **Settings**. 
2. On the **Settings** page, you'll see that by default the instructions page opens every time the add-in is run. Use the radio buttons to specify that the instructions page will appear only the first time that the add-in is run. 
3. Close the task pane and then relaunch the add-in by selecting the **Show** button again. The add-in will open with the **Find and Replace** page instead of the instructions page. 
4. Navigate to the **Settings** page again. You can select the **Show Instructions** button to open the instructions page, or change the instructions setting back to open the instructions page every time the add-in is run.

## Understand the code

All of the code that uses the Office and Word JavaScript APIs is in the file word.document.service.ts. The `compareLocationWith()` method that this sample demonstrates is in the `replaceFoundStringsWithExceptions()` method. 

The code first gets a collection of all the ranges that match the user's search term. It then gets a collection of all the paragraph ranges in the document. 

```let foundItems: Word.SearchResultCollection = context.document.body.search(searchString, { matchCase: false, matchWholeWord: true }).load();```
```let paras : Word.ParagraphCollection = context.document.body.paragraphs.load();```

After the collections are loaded with a call of `context.sync()`, the code creates an array of the paragraph ranges that the user excludes from the replacement. (Note that `excludedParagraph` is a parameter passed to the method.)

```let excludedRanges: Array<Word.Range> = [];```
```excludedRanges.push(paras.items[excludedParagraph].getRange('Whole'));```

The code then loops through the iterables to determine which search results are inside excluded paragraphs and which are not. For each search result, this fact is recorded in a `IReplacementCandidate` object. The `compareLocationWith()` method returns "Inside" if the search result is inside the excluded paragraph. It returns "Equal" if the search result is a paragraph by itself and has been excluded. 

```
for (let i = 0; i < foundItems.items.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < excludedRanges.length; j++) {
        replacementCandidates.push({
            range: foundItems.items[i],
            locationRelation: foundItems.items[i].compareLocationWith(excludedRanges[j])
        });
    }
}
```
The replacement candidate objects are loaded with a call to `context.sync()` and then the code iterates through them, replacing the search string with the replace string only in the paragraphs which are not in an excluded paragraph.

```
replacementCandidates.forEach(function (item) {
    switch (item.locationRelation.value) {
        case "Inside":
        case "Equal":
            break;
        default:
            item.range.insertText(replaceString, 'Replace');
    }
});
```
See the `replaceDocumentContent` method of the same file to see how the Word `insertText` and `nsertParagraph` methods are used to insert sample content into the document.
